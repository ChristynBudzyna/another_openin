Written in the fifties as 'a new musical of the twenties,'' this is still considered the most successful, and witty of the send-up musicals. Set against the backdrop of the French Riviera, this romantic spoof of 1920's musical comedies tells the story of English heiress, Polly, who is longing for only one thing: a boyfriend. Polly's father, convinced any boy who isn't wealthy will court Polly strictly for her financial situation, forbids her to engage any potential suitors. Honoring his wishes, Polly explains to Tony, the messenger boy with whom she's fallen in love, that she is no rich girl. This is just the tip of the mistaken identity iceberg as love proceeds to charmingly find its way through nearly every member of the cast and bring them all to a happy ending. The Boy Friend is an essential Golden Age musical.

Show.create(title: "By Jeeves", composer: "Andrew Lloyd Webber", lyricist: "Ayckbourn", librettist:"Ayckbourn", description:"From the classic P.G. Wodehouse stories of the amiably dense Bertie Wooster and his estimable manservant Jeeves, two of the theater's most celebrated talents have fashioned a jolly chamber musical chock full of hilarity and invention. Bertie is looking forward to enlivening a charity benefit at a church hall when his beloved banjo mysteriously goes missing. Assisted by the unflappable Jeeves, Bertie instead entertains the audience with an improvised account of how he and two chums - with, as one song puts it, 'a collective I.Q. of around 42' - all got their names and identities confused in the course of one riotously raucous weekend. This tale of escalating chaos and labyrinthine high jinx unfolds to the accompaniment of one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most vivacious and sprightly scores. BY JEEVES cleverly intertwines the twin English passions for amateur theatrics and bumbling silliness, taking us back to a time when flirty girls pursued men, not careers, and where good breeding took precedence over brainpower.", cast_size:"medium", show_type:"book musical", age_of_actors:"adults", length: "full-length" , dance_heavy: false, music_genre:"classic musical theatre", licensing_company: "rnh", licensing_link: "http://www.rnh.com/show/19/By-Jeeves")
